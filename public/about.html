    <h1>~ About USTown.live ~</h1>
    <p>This game aims to help freshmen better adapt to the environment of HKUST. Under the virus, freshmen are unable to stay on campus to have lessons. This game enables them to freely explore the campus. This game is made multiplayer so it is like actually being on campus interacting with others.</p>
    <p>There is no correct way to play this game. You can go around and explore anywhere you want. However, with the multiplayer feature, you can ask seniors you know to bring you around the map, introducing new places to you.</p>
    <p>This game took me around two weeks, from designing the game to implementing the codes. Also with the help of others, mentioned in credits, modelling different parts of the map. I'll consider expanding the game if it receives enough support.</p>
    <p>If you enjoy this game and want to show support, you can contact me. You can also contact me on other things such as bugs, suggestions, questions or even if you want to help.</p>
