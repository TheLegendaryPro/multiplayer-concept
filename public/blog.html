    <h1>Initial Release</h1>
    <h2>2020-8-14</h2>
    <p>This game is released after about two weeks of work. Looking back, I had the idea of making a game based on HKUST on 24 July. Since then I started looking into platforms and frameworks I can develop my game on. I choosed web-based phaser.io at last because it is accessible and popular. After that, I searched for different tutorials on various topics, including multiplayer feature, dungeon based games, various RPGs, to equip me with the knowledge of creating such a game.</p>
    <p>(talk about how it turned out)</p>
